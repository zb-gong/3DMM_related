# 3DMM_related
This repository contains source codes and work when conducting research on 3DMM. 
Several independent works are done including: 
  1. 3DMM fitting
  2. deformation transfer 
  3. facial rigging 
  4. self-supervised 3DMM based on Deep Learning<br>
Please refer to corresponding folders for codes.
